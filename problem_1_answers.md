1. The colspan="3" attribute of the <th> node defines that the width of the header of the table should be of 3 columns. When I changed it to "1", the width of the cell would be only 1 column.


2. In html the only style appplied to the th element containing "Rank" is  align="center". This will place the text the center of the cell. The CSS styling is done in the bls_content.css. One of the properties of the selector th is "font-weight", which is set to bold. Another selector is the ".main-content td, .main-content th". This selector has the property of padding-top/right/bottom/left by 3px, meaning that there should be 3 px space between the word "Rank" in all the directions (top/right/bottom/left). Another selector is the "th[Attributes Style]", whose "text-align" property is set to "-webkit-center". This is equivalent to the html style align='center'. This also aligns the text of the cell to center. I did some research and found out webkit-center is only good in safari and chrome. Using "center" instead of "-webkit-center" is a better idea because, it works in every browser.  

3. DOM and raw source code are very similar, but different. Source is the direct responce from the HTTP request to the server, which loads only the HTML but does not load any javascript. But DOM on the other hand loads javascript, along with the HTML. The biggest difference between the DOM inspector and the HTML source code is that you can edit the HTML or CSS in your DOM tree to see any quick changes, although the effect is only temporary, but you can't do that with source code. This is one of the reason why I would use the DOM. Another reason why I would use the DOM inspector is when you select an html tag or hover over it, the DOM will show the CSS of tag on the right along with the geometry of the element. It will also highlight the element on the webpage, making it easy to find the element in the source code. The CSS file is normally a seperate file for websites, some websites have mulitple, so you will not find CSS in the html Source code. You will have to open the CSS file, included in the header of the HTML page, in another page. Also, source code is one long file, whereas the DOM element hides the child elements under the parent elements, making it easy to follow and understand the code. The source is useful when you want to understand the structure of the webpage and the complete styling of the webpage.
