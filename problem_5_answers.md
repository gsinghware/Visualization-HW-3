1. The chart is missing almost everything I look for in a bar chart. (Title, labels for the bars and a scale for how long each bar is.). No one can tell what data this bar chart is displaying. One thing we can see is that the data is sorted.

2. 	The first "g" element translates the chart to the right by margin.left and down by margin.top.
	The second "g" element is a container that keeps all the bars in the chart together. 
	The third "g" elements defines the length of each of the bars in the chart.

3. Adding the "rect" after the "text" will hide the text element under the rect, so you won't be able to see the text.
