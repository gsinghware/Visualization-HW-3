1. The domain() function is the data range upon which the scale is calculated. To break it all down: <br>

	d3.selectAll("tbody tr") tells d3 to first select all elements first selects all the "tbody" tags, then inside "tbody" tags, it tells d3 to selects all the "tr" tags. Right now all the columns have been selected because they all the columns are inside the "tr" tag. This is all returned in a multidimensional array.

	d3.selectAll("tbody tr")[0] selects the first member of the multidimensional array generated by d3.selectAll(). Then the length of this array is 1 based, 50, but if we access 50th element, it will be undefined because javascipt starts the array index from 0. This is the reason why we subtract 1 from the length.

2. Each call to color returns a hexadecimal RGB (Red, Green, Black) color code: 
	color(0) -> "#ff4500"	(orange color because range is from orange to gray)
	color(10) -> "#f25e26"	(reddish orange color)
	color(150) -> "#42ffff" (light blue color)

3. The minimum and maximum values of the Rate are 2.9 and 9.0. Now, values here too small and can't take up lot of different colors, whereas 0 to 50 will give us alot of different color. This scale would be good for small data that is not clusted, because if data is clusted it would be hard to tell the difference in which color represent which point.
