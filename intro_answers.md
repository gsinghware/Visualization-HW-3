1. If we were interested in understanding summary statistics at a glance (minimum, maximum, etc.), how could you improve the display of the table?

One way to improve the display of the table is to make the tables sortable by RANK, STATE, and RATE. Another way is to simply add another table where you can include the MAX, MIN, Standard Deviation, Average, and Variance.

2. Find three varied examples on the web that present tabular data in a different layout or in more visually compelling, complete, interactive or interesting ways.

a) [NBA Playoffs Player Stats](http://www.nbastuffer.com/2014_NBA_Playoffs_Player_Stats.html)
	This visulization is a tabular. It allows you to sort by the columns and when you sort a column, the entire column is highlighted. It allows allows you to filter your the data by Teams, Player Positions and Players.

b) [Poverty & Equity](http://povertydata.worldbank.org/poverty/country/)
	This interactive visualization allows users to select a region or country. Then it will display the GDP accordingly in small table with more stats. It also displays bars graphs of poverty by years in the region or country selected. The bars are also interactive. You can select the earnings of the poor by day ($1.25, $1.50). It also has a interactive map which can show the poverty by years in video, something similar to the video we watched in class.

c) [The Road to 200 Million Users](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2009/03/29/business/29face.graf01.ready.html)
	This visulization shows how Facebook has evolved from college universies to a global social networking website with over 200 million users from 2004 to 2009.
